# üî• Algerian Forest Fire Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of forest fires in Algeria based on meteorological and environmental data. By analyzing key factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, the model aims to assist in early detection and prevention of wildfires.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset comprises observations from two regions in Algeria: Bejaia and Sidi Bel-Abbes, collected between June and September 2012. Key features include:

- **Temperature (¬∞C)**: Noon temperature ranging from 22 to 42¬∞C
- **Relative Humidity (%)**: Values between 21% and 90%
- **Wind Speed (km/h)**: Ranging from 6 to 29 km/h
- **Rainfall (mm)**: Daily totals from 0 to 16.8 mm
- **Fire Weather Index (FWI) Components**:
  - FFMC: 28.6 to 92.5
  - DMC: 1.1 to 65.9
  - DC: 7 to 220.4
  - ISI: 0 to 18.5
  - BUI: 1.1 to 68
  - FWI: 0 to 31.1
- **Classes**: Binary classification indicating 'fire' or 'not fire'
